# Design system

- for headings and body text go to [typescale.com](https://typescale.com/).
- used 1.2 minor third.
- added 2 more upper headings starts with 68.80px

# Spacing

### 4 point grid system: 

whenever we are giving space betweeen any elements it should be a multiple of 4.
<strong> 4, 8, 12, 16, ... </strong>

- always have less spacing to the elements inside the container eg: padding of 16 should have elements with space less than 16 i.e. 8, 4.
- learn to break that rule when you have to seperate elements from same container go up like 16, 20 etc for creating seperation. mostly used for vertical spacing
